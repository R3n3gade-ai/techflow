ARMS Module Specification
Two New Modules — Addendum to FSD v1.1
Module A: PTRH Full Automation (Tier 0)
Module B: Defensive Sleeve Harvest Protocol (DSHP)
For: Josh Paul — Lead Developer
Version: 1.0 — March 26, 2026
Classification: CONFIDENTIAL — GP and Development Use Only
These two modules close two identified gaps in the ARMS v4.0 architecture. Both are fully
buildable today with zero new dependencies. Build Module A first — it is simpler and
eliminates a recurring daily decision queue item immediately.
"Silence is trust in the architecture."

0. Why These Two Modules Exist
0.1 The PTRH Gap
The Permanent Tail Risk Hedge (PTRH) has fully deterministic rules in PM Playbook v4.0: sizing
multipliers are defined by regime, the roll trigger is defined at 30 DTE, and regime-transition resizing is
automatic. Despite this, PTRH sizing confirmation has appeared in the PM decision queue every
morning because the connection between the rules and the execution pipeline does not yet exist.
A decision queue item that requires no human judgment is not a safeguard. It is latency. The PM
reviewing a sizing confirmation that the system already knows the answer to is the precise failure mode
ARMS is designed to eliminate. Module A closes this gap permanently. PTRH becomes fully Tier 0. It
disappears from the decision queue. The PM sees its status in the module panel as confirmation it ran
correctly — not as a request for approval.
One legitimate exception is preserved: a one-time coverage review when a dual-risk scenario is
identified — such as the current Iran war plus Warsh nomination combination — that may require a
coverage standard update. This is Tier 2: PM confirms the updated standard once, and the system
enforces it going forward. It is not a recurring daily item.
0.2 The Defensive Sleeve Harvest Gap
The defensive sleeve is designed for capital preservation, not return generation. SGOV holds value.
SGOL hedges inflation and geopolitical risk. DBMF captures trend momentum. STRC generates yield.
None of these instruments are in the portfolio to produce alpha. That is their design.
But markets do not respect instrument intent. Under specific conditions — war bids, commodity super-
cycles, yield compression, trend momentum — defensive instruments generate significant price
appreciation well beyond their designed function. When this happens, the current ARMS architecture
has no mechanism to act. PERM only applies to the equity book. The defensive sleeve sits outside it.
The consequence is predictable: an instrument that was bought as insurance becomes a speculative
position through appreciation, its weight drifts above its target, its defensive function is diluted, and
when the conditions that drove the gain reverse — as they always do — the gain evaporates without
having been captured. The architecture watched the gain appear and watched it disappear.
Module B closes this gap. The Defensive Sleeve Harvest Protocol extends gain-harvesting discipline
into the defensive sleeve with instrument-appropriate thresholds and a simple rebalancing mechanic. It
does not change the sleeve's defensive character. It ensures that when the sleeve produces
unexpected gains, those gains are crystallized rather than surrendered.

from the regime-required level due to NAV changes.
1.3 Dual-Risk Coverage Standard (One-Time Tier 2 Review)
When a dual-risk scenario is present — defined as two simultaneous independent downside pressures
on QQQ, such as the current Iran war plus Kevin Warsh hawkish rate overlay — the PM executes a
ARMS Module Specification — PTRH Automation + DSHP | Addendum to FSD v1.1 | CONFIDENTIAL
Achelion Capital Management, LLC · Flow. Illumination. Discipline. Conviction. 5
one-time coverage standard review. This is not a recurring daily item. It occurs once per identified dual-
risk event.
The review determines whether the current PTRH notional provides adequate coverage for the dual-
risk scenario. The standard question: does the existing put notional provide meaningful payoff if QQQ
falls to the dual-risk downside estimate? If the current standard covers −15% and the dual-risk scenario
implies −20% to −25%, the PM sets a new coverage standard. The system then enforces that standard
automatically going forward until the dual-risk event resolves.
Trigger Two simultaneous independent downside pressures identified by
the PM or by ARMS signal analysis
Process PM reviews current notional coverage vs dual-risk downside
estimate. Documents updated standard in session log.
System action ARMS adjusts PTRH notional to meet the updated standard.
Holds until PM signals dual-risk resolved.
Resolution When dual-risk event resolves — e.g., Iran ceasefire confirmed
AND Warsh confirmation complete — system reverts to regime-
standard multiplier automatically.
Tier classification Tier 2 — PM confirms once. System executes and maintains.
1.4 What Disappears From the Decision Queue
After Module A is deployed, PTRH never appears in the PM decision queue under normal
conditions.
The daily monitor module status panel shows PTRH status as a confirmation: current multiplier, current
notional, DTE of nearest expiry, last roll date. The PM reads this as a status report, not an action item.
If Module A encounters an execution failure — broker API error, insufficient liquidity, options market
closed — an ALERT fires in the module status panel and a DANGER alert appears in the alerts section.
The PM acts on failures, not on normal operations.

MODULE B — DEFENSIVE SLEEVE HARVEST PROTOCOL
DSHP — Gain Crystallization in the Defensive Sleeve
2. Module B Overview
File src/engine/dshp.py — new module. Extends perm.py logic into
defensive sleeve.
Tier classification Tier 1 — default execute with PM veto window. System queues
trim. PM has 4-hour window. Silence = execute.
Build time 1-2 days — extends existing PERM module logic. Same gain-
measurement pattern, different thresholds and mechanic.
Dependencies Portfolio snapshot (NAV + sleeve positions) · market data feed
for sleeve instrument prices · brokerage API for execution
Ongoing cost $0 — no new dependencies
PERM relationship DSHP is a companion to PERM, not a replacement. PERM
governs equity book positions (covered calls on >30% gains).
DSHP governs defensive sleeve positions (trim-to-target on
>20% appreciation). Different instruments, different mechanics,
same philosophy: gains are crystallized systematically.
2.1 The Core Principle
When a defensive instrument appreciates beyond its designed function, it has become a
speculative position. DSHP converts it back into a defensive position and banks the gain.
A 2% allocation to SGOL that appreciates to 2.8% is no longer functioning as a 2% defensive hedge. It
is a 2.8% allocation to gold — and the excess 0.8% is now exposed to the same reversal risk that
produced the gain. Left unmanaged, this is a guaranteed outcome: the gain appeared, the gain will
reverse, the architecture did nothing. DSHP prevents this.
The mechanic is simple: when a sleeve instrument appreciates beyond its harvest threshold, DSHP
trims it back to its target weight and redeposits the proceeds into SGOV or cash within the defensive
sleeve. The total sleeve allocation remains 14%. The instrument returns to its designed weight and
function. The gain is in SGOV, not at risk.
2.2 Instrument-Specific Rules
ARMS Module Specification — PTRH Automation + DSHP | Addendum to FSD v1.1 | CONFIDENTIAL
Achelion Capital Management, LLC · Flow. Illumination. Discipline. Conviction. 9
Each instrument in the defensive sleeve has its own harvest threshold, mechanic, and rationale. They
are not treated identically because they are not identical instruments.

Trim to 2.0%

SGOV
(within
defensive
sleeve)
Gold appreciation is
driven by war bids and
inflation fears — both
mean-revert. Crystallize
the gain. Maintain the
hedge at its designed
weight.

(within

Managed futures gains
are trend-captured — they

(appreciation OR weight
drift) catches both slow

moves. Oil trend reversal

N/A STRC is a yield

Its value is the income

let it pay.

2.3 Harvest Trigger Logic
DSHP runs daily at 5:25 AM CT as part of the module sweep. It checks each eligible instrument against
its trigger condition. When a trigger fires, DSHP queues a Tier 1 trim action with a 4-hour veto window.
def check_dshp_triggers(sleeve_positions: Dict,
nav: float) -> List[HarvestAction]:
actions = []
# SGOL — appreciation trigger
sgol_pos = sleeve_positions['SGOL']
sgol_appreciation = (sgol_pos.current_value - sgol_pos.entry_value)

Achelion Capital Management, LLC · Flow. Illumination. Discipline. Conviction. 10
/ sgol_pos.entry_value
if sgol_appreciation > SGOL_HARVEST_THRESHOLD: # 0.20
target_value = nav * SGOL_TARGET_WEIGHT # 0.02
trim_amount = sgol_pos.current_value - target_value
actions.append(HarvestAction(
instrument='SGOL',
action_type='TRIM_TO_TARGET',
trim_amount=trim_amount,
proceeds_to='SGOV',
trigger='APPRECIATION',
appreciation_pct=sgol_appreciation,
tier=1,
veto_window_hours=4.0
))
# DBMF — appreciation OR weight drift trigger
dbmf_pos = sleeve_positions['DBMF']
dbmf_appreciation = (dbmf_pos.current_value - dbmf_pos.entry_value)
/ dbmf_pos.entry_value
dbmf_weight = dbmf_pos.current_value / nav
dbmf_drift = dbmf_weight - DBMF_TARGET_WEIGHT # 0.05
if dbmf_appreciation > DBMF_HARVEST_THRESHOLD # 0.15
or dbmf_drift > DBMF_DRIFT_THRESHOLD: # 0.015
target_value = nav * DBMF_TARGET_WEIGHT
trim_amount = dbmf_pos.current_value - target_value
trigger_type = 'APPRECIATION' if dbmf_appreciation > 0.15
else 'WEIGHT_DRIFT'
actions.append(HarvestAction(
instrument='DBMF',
action_type='TRIM_TO_TARGET',
trim_amount=trim_amount,
proceeds_to='SGOV',
trigger=trigger_type,
tier=1,
veto_window_hours=4.0
))
return actions
2.4 Tier 1 Confirmation Queue Integration
Every DSHP harvest action routes through the existing Tier 1 confirmation queue
(src/execution/confirmation_queue.py). The three-option interface applies identically to DSHP as to any
Tier 1 action:
• Option 1 — No new information, execute: PM has no reason to block. Trim executes
immediately. Session log records 'PM confirmed — no new information.'
ARMS Module Specification — PTRH Automation + DSHP | Addendum to FSD v1.1 | CONFIDENTIAL
Achelion Capital Management, LLC · Flow. Illumination. Discipline. Conviction. 11
• Option 2 — New information present, hold: PM has a specific reason to believe the harvest
should not occur at this time. PM documents the reason. Action is paused for up to 24 hours for
PM to provide updated standard.
• Option 3 — Veto with rationale: PM blocks the harvest permanently for this trigger event.
Written rationale required. If PM vetoes more than 2 DSHP actions in a 30-day period, a GP
review is triggered — this is a signal that either the thresholds need recalibration or the PM is
accumulating speculative exposure in the defensive sleeve.
• No response within 4 hours: harvest executes automatically. Silence is trust in the architecture.

2.6 Configuration Constants
All thresholds are stored in a configuration file and can be adjusted by the PM without code changes.
Josh should implement a config validation step that alerts if any threshold is set outside a reasonable
range.

SGOL_HARVEST_THRESHOLD = 0.200 # harvest if >20% appreciation
DBMF_TARGET_WEIGHT = 0.050 # 5.0% of NAV
DBMF_HARVEST_THRESHOLD = 0.150 # harvest if >15% appreciation
DBMF_DRIFT_THRESHOLD = 0.015 # harvest if weight drifts >1.5pp above target
# STRC and SGOV: no harvest triggers — yield and receiver respectively
DSHP_VETO_WINDOW_HOURS = 4.0 # Tier 1 veto window
DSHP_VETO_GP_ALERT_THRESHOLD = 2 # GP review if >2 vetoes in 30 days

3.1 Testing Protocol — Module A
1. Force a regime transition in paper mode: RISK_ON → DEFENSIVE. Verify PTRH multiplier
changes from 1.0× to 1.5× automatically. Verify broker API submits the correct order. Verify
session log captures the transition with old and new sizing.
2. Set a test position to 31 DTE. Verify the roll fires automatically. Verify the new position is at the
same strike and notional. Verify session log captures old expiry, new expiry, and cost of roll.
3. Manually drift the notional to >5% below target in paper mode. Verify the auto-correction fires
within the next daily sweep. Verify session log captures drift_pct and correction action.
4. Simulate a broker API failure. Verify that a DANGER alert fires in the module status panel and
the alerts section. Verify that the daily monitor shows PTRH status as ALERT, not as a decision
queue item.
3.2 Testing Protocol — Module B
5. Set SGOL appreciation to 21% above entry in test data. Verify DSHP fires a Tier 1 harvest
action. Verify the confirmation queue receives it with a 4-hour veto window. Verify the trim
amount equals the difference between current value and target weight value.
6. Let the veto window expire with no PM response. Verify the trim executes automatically. Verify
proceeds are allocated to SGOV. Verify total sleeve allocation remains 14%.
7. Set DBMF weight to 6.6% (1.6pp above 5.0% target — exceeds 1.5pp drift threshold). Verify
DSHP fires on weight drift trigger, not appreciation trigger. Verify session log records trigger
type as WEIGHT_DRIFT.
ARMS Module Specification — PTRH Automation + DSHP | Addendum to FSD v1.1 | CONFIDENTIAL

8. Submit a PM veto via Option 3. Verify the harvest is blocked. Verify written rationale is required.
Verify the action is logged as VETO with rationale captured.
9. Submit 3 vetoes in a 30-day window in test mode. Verify GP review alert fires automatically on
the third veto.
3.3 File Structure Update
The following files are added or updated by these two modules. Update the FSD v1.1 file structure table
accordingly.
File Status Change
src/engine/tail_hedge.py UPDATED Full Tier 0 automation added. Regime sizing
table, DTE roll logic, drift correction, dual-risk
override support.
src/engine/dshp.py NEW Defensive Sleeve Harvest Protocol. SGOL and
DBMF triggers, Tier 1 queue integration,
SGOV reallocation mechanic.
src/config/dshp_config.py NEW All DSHP threshold constants. Adjustable
without code changes.
src/reporting/daily_monitor.py UPDATED DSHP gain tracking fields added to defensive
sleeve section. PTRH status display updated
to confirmation panel (not decision queue).
src/execution/confirmation_queue.py UPDATED DSHP harvest actions added as a new Tier 1
action type. No structural changes required —
same queue mechanic.
After these two modules are deployed: PTRH runs itself. The defensive sleeve harvests its
own gains. The daily monitor reflects both as confirmations, not requests. The blade is
sharper.
