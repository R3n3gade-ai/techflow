ARMS Module Specification
Addendum 2 to FSD v1.1
Module C: Customer Dependency Map (CDM)
Module D: Thesis Dependency Checker (TDC)
For: Josh Paul — Lead Developer
Version: 1.0 — March 26, 2026
Classification: CONFIDENTIAL — GP and Development Use Only
These two modules close the cross-sector signal propagation gap. The gap was identified
when the daily monitor failed to surface MU's downstream exposure to the Google antitrust
ruling. That class of risk — legal or regulatory impairment of a named demand driver — is
now systematically detected.
"The system catches what the PM should not have to catch."

0. Why These Two Modules Exist — The Incident That
Created Them
On March 26, 2026, the daily ARMS monitor failed to surface a material risk to MU's thesis.
The PM caught it. The system did not. These modules ensure that class of failure does not
recur.
The Google antitrust case — specifically the DOJ pursuing structural remedies including potential
Chrome divestiture and restrictions on default search agreements — creates direct downstream risk to
Micron's conviction thesis. The connection runs three hops: Google faces legal constraints → Google's
AI infrastructure capex is impaired → HBM memory demand from Google weakens → MU's primary
bull case thesis takes a direct hit.
The daily monitor flagged MU as OK. It should have flagged WATCH with a cross-reference alert citing
the Google antitrust development as a named demand driver under material legal uncertainty. It did not
— because the architecture has no mechanism to connect a legal proceeding against a named entity to
the portfolio positions that depend on that entity for thesis validation.
This is not a price alert failure. MU's price was stable. This is a thesis integrity failure — the system was
not watching whether the reasons we own what we own are still intact. That is a more dangerous blind
spot than a price alert miss, because thesis deterioration precedes price deterioration. The PM who
catches it early preserves capital. The PM who catches it late is managing a loss.
The Google-MU connection also has broader FEM implications. NVDA, AVGO, ANET, and MRVL all
have material Google revenue exposure. A single legal proceeding against one hyperscaler propagates
risk across five positions simultaneously. The Customer Dependency Map makes that propagation
visible in real time. The Thesis Dependency Checker makes it actionable.
These two modules together form the thesis integrity layer of ARMS — the system that continuously
audits whether the reasons we own each position are still structurally intact, independent of price
performance.

Key insight This module does not predict outcomes. It propagates known
facts — a legal ruling, a regulatory filing, an earnings warning
from a named demand driver — to every dependent position
immediately. Speed and completeness of propagation is the
entire value.
1.1 The Dependency Map Structure
The dependency map is a configuration file that encodes, for each portfolio position, the named entities
whose health is material to the thesis. It is populated manually by the PM when a position enters the
book via SENTINEL and updated when the thesis evolves. It is the machine-readable version of the
Gate 2 SENTINEL answer: who are the non-optional customers, platforms, or infrastructure providers
this company depends on?
The map has three dependency categories. Primary demand drivers are the entities that directly
purchase this company's products or services at material scale. Thesis enablers are the entities whose
continued operation or investment is necessary for the thesis to hold — a hyperscaler that is not yet a
customer but whose capex trajectory the thesis depends on. Regulatory counterparties are the entities
whose legal or regulatory status directly affects the position — a government customer, a platform this
company distributes through, or a regulator with jurisdiction over this company's market.

The following table is the initial population of the CDM for the current equity book. Josh populates this
as the config file on Day 1. The PM reviews and confirms accuracy. It is a living document — updated
every time a position is added, removed, or when the thesis evolves.

1.2 Named Entity Alert Logic
CDM runs a continuous named entity recognition scan against the incoming news feed, SEC EDGAR
filings, and regulatory announcements. When a named entity in the dependency map appears in a new
filing or news item, CDM classifies the event type and propagates an alert to every position that lists
that entity as a dependency.

1.3 The Google-MU Case Study — How CDM Would Have Worked
ARMS Module Specification — CDM + TDC | Addendum 2 to FSD v1.1 | CONFIDENTIAL
Achelion Capital Management, LLC · Flow. Illumination. Discipline. Conviction. 6
This is the exact failure the CDM closes. Walk through it precisely so Josh understands the
design intent.
On the morning of March 26, 2026, the following events were present in public data: (1) Google
antitrust ruling — DOJ pursuing structural remedies including Chrome divestiture. (2) MU conviction
thesis depends on HBM demand from Google as a named primary demand driver.
With CDM live, the sequence would have been:
1. CDM ingests news feed. Named entity recognition identifies 'Google' and 'Alphabet' in antitrust
articles.
2. CDM looks up 'Google' in the dependency map. Finds: MU (primary demand driver), NVDA
(primary demand driver), AMD (primary demand driver), ALAB (primary demand driver), ANET
(primary demand driver), AVGO (thesis enabler), MRVL (primary demand driver).
3. CDM classifies event type: LEGAL_RULING. Severity: CRITICAL.
4. CDM propagates CRITICAL alert to all seven positions simultaneously.
5. Each alert reads: 'Named demand driver GOOG/Alphabet subject to antitrust remedy
proceedings. Structural remedies under consideration may impair AI infrastructure capex.
Thesis dependency review required.'
6. TDC (Module D) receives the propagation signal and queues a thesis integrity review for each
dependent position within the next 6 hours.
7. Daily monitor surfaces a DANGER alert in the alerts section: 'CDM: GOOG legal ruling affects 7
positions. TDC thesis review queued. See dependency cross-reference.'
Total time from event to PM alert: under 30 minutes from ingestion. The PM does not need to be
reading broadly. The system is reading broadly for them and routing the signal to exactly the positions it
affects.

1.5 Daily Monitor Integration
CDM adds two elements to the daily monitor. The first is a cross-reference panel in the equity book
section — each position shows its named dependency alert status alongside its price and flag badges.
The second is a dedicated CDM alert in the alerts section when a CRITICAL or HIGH event fires.
Equity book column added Dependency status badge: CLEAR (green) / WATCH (amber) /
ALERT (red) based on most severe active CDM signal for that
position
Alert format 'CDM ALERT: [NAMED ENTITY] [EVENT TYPE] — affects [N]
positions: [TICKER LIST]. TDC thesis review queued.'

MODULE D — THESIS DEPENDENCY CHECKER
TDC — Continuous Thesis Integrity Auditing
2. Module D Overview
File src/engine/tdc.py — new module
Tier classification Tier 1 — system queues SENTINEL adversarial review. PM has
24-hour response window. Silence = system logs as 'thesis
confirmed by non-response' and continues monitoring.
Build time 2-3 days — requires Claude API integration (already specified in
FSD v1.1 Section 11) and CDM as upstream input
Dependencies CDM (Module C) propagation signals · Claude API wrapper
(src/intelligence/claude_wrapper.py) ·
position_dependency_map.py · session log · SENTINEL gate
records for each position
Ongoing cost ~$0.30-0.50 per thesis review call to Claude API. Estimated 5-10
reviews per week at steady state = ~$10-20/month incremental
API cost
Runs on Two triggers: (1) CDM propagation signal received (immediate),
(2) Weekly scheduled audit every Monday alongside Systematic
Scan Engine
Key distinction TDC does not evaluate price performance. It evaluates thesis
integrity — whether the original reasons for owning a position are
still structurally intact. A position can be performing well on price
while its thesis is quietly being undermined. TDC catches the
thesis deterioration before it becomes price deterioration.
2.1 The Two TDC Triggers
Trigger 1 — CDM propagation (immediate)
When CDM fires a CRITICAL or HIGH alert, TDC receives the signal and immediately runs a thesis
integrity review for every affected position. This is the reactive layer — it responds to known events as
soon as they are detected.
The review asks a single structured question via the Claude API: given this specific development
affecting [NAMED ENTITY], does the original thesis for [POSITION] remain intact? The API call
includes the original SENTINEL gate records for the position, the current CDM event description, and
the three most relevant documents from the knowledge base. It returns a structured JSON response
with a thesis integrity score and a specific bear case articulation if the score falls below the threshold.
ARMS Module Specification — CDM + TDC | Addendum 2 to FSD v1.1 | CONFIDENTIAL
Achelion Capital Management, LLC · Flow. Illumination. Discipline. Conviction. 10
Trigger 2 — Weekly scheduled audit (proactive)
Every Monday at 6AM CT, TDC runs a scheduled thesis integrity audit on every position in the book —
regardless of whether CDM has fired. This is the proactive layer. It catches slow-moving thesis
deterioration that no single news event triggers but that accumulates over time: a named customer
quietly reducing AI capex in earnings calls, a regulatory posture shifting in a series of small rulings, a
technology platform trend moving against the thesis.
The weekly audit pulls the last 7 days of news and filings relevant to each position's named
dependencies and asks: has anything in the past 7 days provided evidence that weakens any of the
original SENTINEL gate assumptions for this position? This is the continuous SENTINEL adversarial
cross-examination that the manual system only runs episodically.
2.2 Thesis Integrity Score
TDC produces a Thesis Integrity Score (TIS) for each position on every review. The TIS is distinct from
the MICS conviction score. MICS measures entry quality. TIS measures ongoing thesis validity.
TIS range Label ARMS response Meaning
8.0 –
10.0
INTACT No action. Log result.
Continue monitoring.
All original thesis assumptions confirmed by
current data. No new bear case evidence.
6.0 – 7.9 WATCH Position flag upgraded
to WATCH if not
already. PM notified in
daily monitor.
One or more thesis assumptions have
weakened but not broken. Bear case
evidence present but not conclusive.
4.0 – 5.9 IMPAIRED SENTINEL adversarial
review queued as Tier
1 action. PM has 24
hours to respond.
Multiple thesis assumptions weakened. Bear
case evidence present and specific.
Conviction reaffirmation or position review
required.
0.0 – 3.9 BROKEN CDF accelerated
review triggered.
SENTINEL full re-run
queued. PM decision
required within 24
hours.
Original thesis no longer supportable by
available evidence. Position requires
immediate review and probable exit planning.
IMPORTANT: TIS IMPAIRED or BROKEN does not automatically trigger a sell order. It triggers a
mandatory human review because thesis assessment is a judgment call that requires the PM's pre-
consensus intelligence. What TIS cannot know is whether the PM has new Category A information — a
direct conversation with a company insider, a pattern recognition from prior cycles — that explains why
the thesis remains intact despite the surface-level evidence. TDC surfaces the question. The PM
answers it.

ARMS Module Specification — CDM + TDC | Addendum 2 to FSD v1.1 | CONFIDENTIAL
Achelion Capital Management, LLC · Flow. Illumination. Discipline. Conviction. 12
Continuing from Section 1.3: CDM has propagated a CRITICAL alert to MU citing Google antitrust
proceedings. TDC receives the signal and runs immediately.
8. TDC retrieves MU's original SENTINEL gate records from the knowledge base. Key Gate 2
record: 'HBM memory is non-optional for AI training at scale. Primary buyers: Microsoft, Google,
Amazon, Meta. No substitution available at current HBM3E performance specifications.'
9. TDC retrieves the CDM event description: 'DOJ pursuing structural remedies against
Google/Alphabet including potential Chrome divestiture and default search agreement
restrictions. Legal proceedings ongoing with 12-24 month resolution timeline.'
10. TDC runs Claude API thesis review. The model assesses: does potential Google capex
impairment materially weaken the Gate 2 non-optional thesis for MU?
11. API response: TIS score 6.2 — WATCH. Gates affected: [Gate 2]. Bear case evidence: 'Google
represents approximately 15-20% of HBM demand. Legal proceedings creating capex
uncertainty. Other hyperscalers (Microsoft, Amazon) likely absorb partial slack but full demand
replacement not guaranteed.' Bull case rebuttal: 'AI training demand is supply-constrained, not
demand-constrained at current scale. Google impairment of 15-20% demand may be offset by
Amazon and Microsoft acceleration.'
12. TDC upgrades MU flag to WATCH. Logs TIS score 6.2 with full review record to session log.
13. Daily monitor surfaces: 'TDC WATCH: MU thesis integrity 6.2/10. Google antitrust proceedings
affect named demand driver. Gate 2 assumption partially weakened. Bear case: HBM demand
concentration risk elevated. Bull case: remaining hyperscaler absorption likely sufficient. PM
review recommended.'
The PM now has a specific, structured, evidence-based thesis integrity assessment rather than a price
alert or a generic flag. The decision they make — hold with conviction, reduce weight, or initiate a full
SENTINEL re-check — is informed by exactly the right analysis.

2.6 The Insider Selling Trigger — Closing the ALAB Gap
The ALAB situation identified a second related gap: CEO insider selling is Category A bear case
evidence in the SENTINEL framework but was not a named first-class signal in any ARMS module.
CDM and TDC together close this gap.
Josh should add SEC Form 4 filings to the CDM named entity event types. When a CEO or CFO of a
portfolio company files a Form 4 disclosing open-market sales above a defined threshold — proposed:
$50,000 for C-suite open-market sales, excluding pre-planned 10b5-1 sales — CDM fires a HIGH alert
and TDC runs an immediate thesis review for that position.
Form 4 data source SEC EDGAR full-text search API — free. Specify Form 4 filings
for tickers in the book. File within 2 business days of transaction.
Insider sale threshold Open-market sales >$50,000 by CEO or CFO. 10b5-1 pre-
planned sales excluded — less informative signal.
CDF acceleration Insider sale above threshold triggers a 21-day accelerated CDF
review window. Not an automatic sell. An accelerated review
clock.
TDC response Insider sale classified as HIGH severity. TDC runs thesis review
within 6 hours. Bear case evidence field explicitly populated with
insider sale details.
ALAB application The CEO insider selling that was flagged manually in the daily
monitor for four consecutive days would have been caught and
reviewed automatically on day one under this specification.

3.1 Testing Protocol — Module C (CDM)
14. Seed the news feed with the Google antitrust article from March 26, 2026. Verify CDM identifies
'Google' and 'Alphabet' as named entities. Verify it propagates alerts to NVDA, AMD, MU,
ALAB, ANET, AVGO, and MRVL. Verify TSLA, PLTR, ETN, and VRT do not receive alerts.
15. Simulate a Form 4 filing for ALAB CEO with an open-market sale of $75,000. Verify CDM fires a
HIGH alert for ALAB only. Verify 10b5-1 sale simulation does not trigger the alert.
16. Simulate a positive event for a named entity — Google announces expanded AI capex. Verify
CDM logs it as LOW severity and generates no alert. Verify no TDC review is queued.
17. Verify all CDM events are logged to the session log with entity name, event type, source,
affected positions, severity, and timestamp.
3.2 Testing Protocol — Module D (TDC)
18. Trigger a TDC review manually for MU using the Google antitrust event description. Verify the
Claude API call returns valid JSON. Verify the TIS score is in the WATCH range (6.0-7.9). Verify
the gates_affected field includes Gate 2. Verify the bear_case_evidence field is populated.

19. Trigger a TDC weekly audit for all 12 positions. Verify all positions receive a TIS score. Verify
the audit completes within 30 minutes. Verify total API cost is below $6 for a full 12-position
audit.
20. Simulate a BROKEN thesis scenario (TIS < 4.0). Verify CDF accelerated review is triggered.
Verify PM review is queued as Tier 1 action with 24-hour window. Verify the session log
captures the full review record.
21. Allow a Tier 1 PM review window to expire with no response. Verify the session log records
'thesis confirmed by non-response' — not an execution action. TDC is advisory. It never
executes a trade.

3.4 What Disappears From Human Responsibility After These Modules Are
Built
This is the measure of the blade sharpening. After CDM and TDC are live, the following are no longer
the PM's responsibility to catch manually:
• Cross-sector signal propagation — a legal ruling against a named entity automatically reaches
every dependent position within 30 minutes.
• Thesis integrity monitoring — every position is audited weekly against its original SENTINEL
gate assumptions. Deterioration is flagged before it becomes price deterioration.
ARMS Module Specification — CDM + TDC | Addendum 2 to FSD v1.1 | CONFIDENTIAL
Achelion Capital Management, LLC · Flow. Illumination. Discipline. Conviction. 17
• Insider selling detection — Form 4 filings trigger automatic CDM alerts and CDF acceleration.
The four-day ALAB delay becomes a same-day detection.
• Hyperscaler capex monitoring — earnings warnings from Microsoft, Google, Amazon, or Meta
automatically propagate to every position in the book with exposure to that entity.
• Regulatory event monitoring — DOJ filings, BIS export control rulemakings, SEC investigations
— all monitored against named counterparties and propagated to dependent positions
automatically.
What remains the PM's responsibility: providing the pre-consensus intelligence — the Category A
knowledge from direct conversations, the 28-year pattern recognition — that the system cannot

it.
The gap that allowed the Google-MU connection to be missed is now closed. The system
catches what the PM should not have to catch.
