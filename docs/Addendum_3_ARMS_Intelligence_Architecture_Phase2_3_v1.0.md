Classification: CONFIDENTIAL — GP and Development Use Only
The PM staring at a monitor is the failure mode. This document specifies the architecture
that puts the PM in the room where Category A intelligence is created — not watching a
dashboard waiting to approve what the system already knows.
"See it before the internet does."

0. The Design Principle That Governs Everything
Every minute the PM spends confirming what the system already knows is a minute not
spent in the room where Category A intelligence is created. The architecture exists to
free the PM entirely from the execution and decision layer — so that the only thing the
PM does is see what the data cannot yet see.
This document specifies the architecture that operationalizes that principle completely. It is built on a
single governing question that Josh must ask about every human touchpoint in the system:
Is this decision based on math, process, and data inflow — or does it require pre-consensus
human intelligence that no data feed can provide?
If the answer is math, process, or data — it is automated. No exceptions. No confirmation windows for
deterministic outcomes. No decision queue items that repeat daily without change. The system
executes. The PM is not notified unless the system fails.
If the answer is pre-consensus human intelligence — it goes to the PM immediately, with full context,
structured as a specific question that requires a specific answer. Not a general alert. Not a price
notification. A structured question: does your Category A knowledge change this recommendation?
The architecture that follows is the complete implementation of this principle across the anticipatory
intelligence layer and the full execution autonomy layer. Phase 2 builds the intelligence. Phase 3 closes
the last human touchpoints in execution. By the end of Phase 3, the PM's interaction with ARMS is
three things: seeding new thesis ideas through SENTINEL, answering specific Category A questions
when the system surfaces them, and reviewing the monthly session log analytics. Everything else runs
without them.

1. The Three Layers of Anticipatory Intelligence
Anticipatory intelligence operates at three depths of forward visibility. Each layer sees further ahead
than the one before it. Each requires more sophisticated signal processing. All three are buildable with

2. Layer 2 — Anticipatory Signal Specifications
These four signals are the pre-consensus intelligence layer. All are free. All are buildable in
Phase 2. All connect directly to the CDM thesis dependency structure already built.
2.1 Earnings Language Velocity Tracker (ELVT)
File src/intelligence/elvt.py — new module
Data source SEC EDGAR full-text search — earnings call transcripts via 8-K
filings. Free API.
Runs Quarterly after each earnings season + on-demand when CDM
fires for a named entity
Build time 1 week — Claude API already specified. Transcript parsing is
incremental.
Cost ~$0.30 per transcript analysis via Claude API. ~$30-50/month at
full Architecture AB coverage.
ELVT tracks how language changes across consecutive earnings calls for every named entity in the
CDM map. Not what they say — how they say it, and whether the direction is changing. Three
language categories are scored on every transcript.

The ELVT score is not the content of any single transcript. It is the velocity of change across
consecutive transcripts. A company that shifts from conditional to definitive capex language across
three consecutive quarters is describing an investment decision that has been made internally but has
not yet appeared in a financial filing. That is a 2-3 quarter leading indicator.

When a hyperscaler is about to accelerate data center investment, its job postings in specific categories
increase 6 to 9 months before the capital spend appears in any financial filing. This is because hiring
decisions precede procurement decisions — you hire the team before you buy the equipment. JPVI
tracks posting velocity for named CDM entities across four job categories that are leading indicators of
AI infrastructure spend.

A 30% month-over-month increase in data center infrastructure engineering postings at Microsoft or
Google is not a noise signal. It is a company that has decided to build and is hiring to execute. The
equipment orders follow 6 to 9 months later. ARMS sees the hiring before the market sees the orders.

2.3 Patent Filing Velocity Tracker (PFVT)
File src/intelligence/pfvt.py — new module
Data source USPTO PatentsView API — free bulk data. Updated weekly.
Runs Monthly — lower frequency signal. Patent velocity changes
slowly but leads by 12-36 months.
Build time 1 week — USPTO API is documented and free. Mapping
categories to thesis structures is the primary design work.

Cost $0 — USPTO bulk data is a public good.
Patent applications are filed 12 to 18 months before products ship and 24 to 36 months before they
reach material revenue. When a company begins filing patents in a specific technology category, it is
describing its competitive position 2 to 3 years from now. When a hyperscaler begins filing patents in a
new memory architecture or networking topology, it is describing its infrastructure requirements 2 years
hence — requirements that named ARMS positions will be asked to fulfill.

Physical capital movement precedes financial reporting by 2 to 4 quarters. When TSMC ships an
unusually large volume of advanced packaging materials, something significant is being built. When
hyperscaler equipment orders arrive at specific ports in unusual volume, a data center expansion is

underway that will not appear in any earnings call for 6 months. The supply chain does not lie — it is
the physical reality of investment decisions already made.
Phase 2 SCCR monitors two specific patterns against the CDM dependency map. The first is TSMC-
related shipping activity from Taiwan to major US and Asian data center hubs. The second is
hyperscaler server equipment import volumes at key US ports. Both are available in public manifest
data. Both provide 2 to 4 quarter leading indicators of the AI infrastructure demand that flows to NVDA,
MU, ALAB, ANET, AVGO, and MRVL.

3. The Closed Learning Loop — How ARMS Gets Smarter
The signals are not the edge. The edge is having a thesis framework that tells the system
which signals matter — and a learning loop that continuously improves the signal weights
based on which ones were actually predictive.
The four Layer 2 signals produce data. The learning loop converts that data into improving signal
weights over time. This is the machine learning layer that Renaissance built over 30 years. ARMS
builds it from day one — because the session log, the MICS formula, and the CCM are the architecture
of the learning loop.
The loop runs quarterly. It asks three questions about each signal across each thesis.
Question Method Output
Was this signal
predictive?
Correlate signal readings from 3-6
months ago against subsequent
thesis performance (TIS score
movement, price performance vs
QQQ, MICS score accuracy).
Spearman rank correlation.
Predictive accuracy score per
signal per thesis type. Stored in
session log.
Was the signal lead
time correct?
Measure the actual lag between
signal elevation and thesis outcome.
Compare to assumed lead time.
Adjust lead time assumption.
Updated lead time estimates per
signal per entity. Feeds JPVI and
ELVT timing.
Did any signal
combination
outperform any single
signal?
Test pairwise and three-way signal
combinations against outcomes.
Identify whether ELVT + JPVI
together is more predictive than
either alone.
Signal combination weights for
multi-signal scoring. Feeds
forward into MICS Gate 3
supplementary scoring.
The output of the learning loop is not a trading signal. It is a weight update — which signals get more
influence in the Gate 3 mispricing score and which get less, based on their actual track record of
predicting thesis outcomes for each specific position type. Over 8 to 12 quarters of data, the system
builds a position-type-specific signal model that is continuously validated against its own history.
This is the exact architecture Renaissance used. They did not know in advance which signals would be
predictive. They built the infrastructure to measure it and let the data decide. ARMS does the same —
with the additional constraint that every signal must have a causal explanation rooted in the SENTINEL
thesis framework. No correlation without causation. That constraint is what prevents overfitting.

4. Full Execution Autonomy — Closing Every Human
Touchpoint
This section is the most important in the document. It specifies, exhaustively, every
remaining human touchpoint in ARMS and the specific architecture that eliminates each
one.
The goal is a system where the PM's daily interaction with ARMS is zero unless one of three conditions
is true: (1) a Category A intelligence question has been surfaced that requires pre-consensus human
judgment, (2) a SENTINEL thesis seed requires the PM's Gate 6 source declaration, or (3) a GP-level
structural decision has been triggered. Everything else executes without PM involvement.
The following table maps every current human touchpoint to its elimination specification. Josh works
through this list systematically. Each row is a build task.

Tier 1 Tier 0 Module B (DSHP) currently specified as
Tier 1. After 90 days of validated operation
with zero PM vetoes, promote to Tier 0.
PM sets the thresholds once. System

Tier 1 Tier 0 ARES gates are deterministic. When all 4
gates clear and VARES sizes the tranche,
the order executes. No veto window. The
PM has already declared the thesis.
Regime clearing is the execution trigger.

Tier 1 Tier 0 When unrealized gain exceeds 30% AND
the options market is open AND IV is

Category A knowledge that explains why
the thesis remains intact despite the
evidence? If yes, they provide it. If silence,
system proceeds with CDF acceleration.
SENTINEL new
position initiation
Tier 1 Tier 1 —
preserve
This is the correct human touchpoint. The
PM seeds the thesis. The system runs all 6
gates. If all pass, the position initiates. PM
can provide Category A context via Gate 6.
Silence = system executes at MICS-
implied sizing.
FEM paired trim
recommendation
Tier 1 Tier 0 When FEM reaches ALERT (>80%) for
more than 24 hours AND a specific trim
recommendation is identified by the Master
Engine AND the trim does not require a full
SENTINEL re-run, it executes
automatically. Paired trim is deterministic.

4.1 The Two Legitimate Human Touchpoints — Defined and Bounded
After full execution autonomy is achieved, exactly two human touchpoints remain in the ARMS
architecture. Both are legitimate. Neither is eliminatable. Both are the PM doing what only the PM can
do.
Touchpoint What it requires What makes it irreplaceable
SENTINEL thesis
seeding (Gate 6
source declaration)
PM identifies a company
representing a civilizational shift
before it is in any dataset. PM
declares the source of insight: direct
conversation (Cat A), pattern
recognition (Cat B), or public
synthesis (Cat C). System runs
gates 1-5 automatically. Gate 6 is
the only human gate.
No algorithm can replicate 28
years of market pattern
recognition applied to identifying
what the world will look like before
the data confirms it. This is the
PM's irreducible contribution.
Everything else is the system's
job.
Category A
intelligence response
(TDC
IMPAIRED/BROKEN
flag)
When TDC scores a position as
IMPAIRED or BROKEN, it surfaces
one specific question: do you have
Category A knowledge — a direct
conversation, a pattern recognition
from prior cycles — that explains
why the thesis remains intact despite
the evidence? PM responds or
silently confirms.
The system knows everything that
is knowable from public data. It
cannot know what the PM learned
at dinner last week. The Category
A response gate is the
mechanism by which private pre-
consensus knowledge enters the
system in a documented,
auditable way.
Two touchpoints. Both irreplaceable. Everything else automated. The PM is in Dubai —
not staring at a monitor.

Category A knowledge that

SENTINEL seed
— PM identifies
new thesis
PM is at dinner in Dubai. Hears
something from a TSMC supply
chain contact that suggests a
specific company is about to
become non-optional AI
infrastructure. PM opens the
SENTINEL interface on their
phone and seeds the thesis with
a Gate 6 Cat A declaration.
One action — thesis seeding. System runs
all gates automatically overnight. PM
wakes up to a complete SENTINEL
analysis. If all gates pass, PM has a 4-hour
veto window (default execute). Silence =
system initiates.
Monthly learning
loop
CCM runs quarterly signal
calibration. MICS formula
weights updated. Signal lead
time estimates refined. Session
log analytics delivered.
Zero. PM reviews the monthly analytics
digest as strategic context. No operational
decisions required.
The PM is in Dubai. The system is running. The portfolio is being managed. The only
time the phone buzzes is when the system has a question only the PM can answer.

7. The Architecture in One Statement
The goal of ARMS is not to build a better dashboard. It is not to give the PM better information faster. It
is to remove the PM from every decision that can be made by math, process, and data — so that the
PM's entire cognitive capacity is reserved for the one thing that produces irreplaceable alpha: seeing
what the data cannot yet see.
The anticipatory signal layer described in this document is the system seeing as far ahead as public
data allows. The two legitimate human touchpoints are the system asking the PM to see further still —
through the conversations, the pattern recognition, and the pre-consensus intelligence that 28 years of
market experience produces and no algorithm can replicate.
When this architecture is fully built, Achelion will operate with a level of systematic discipline,
anticipatory intelligence, and execution autonomy that no emerging fund — and very few institutional
funds — can match. The edge is real. The architecture is right. The build sequence is clear.
See it before the internet does. Act before the market does. Let the system do everything the
system can do. Let the PM do everything only the PM can do.
"The PM is in Dubai. The system is running."
