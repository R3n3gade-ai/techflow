0. Purpose of This Document
This document defines two things that ARMS FSD v1.1 does not cover in sufficient detail for Josh to
build without ambiguity: (1) the exact layout specification for the daily ARMS monitor — every section,
its data source, its update frequency, and its position in the operational sequence; and (2) the complete
Mac Mini server architecture that gives ARMS a persistent home, a continuous heartbeat, and a
permanent intelligence layer.
The monitor layout is not a design preference. It is an operational specification that encodes the PM
Playbook v4.0 daily assessment sequence into a visual instrument. Build it in a different order and it
stops being a decision tool and becomes a dashboard. Those are not the same thing.
The Mac Mini architecture closes three structural gaps identified in the strategic review: the absence of
a persistent knowledge base, the absence of a scheduled autonomous execution layer, and the
absence of a direct Claude API integration that makes intelligence available programmatically rather
than through a chat interface.

PART ONE — Daily Monitor Layout Specification
1. Design Principle
The monitor is a decision instrument, not a dashboard. Sequence encodes operational
logic.
The daily monitor layout mirrors the PM Playbook v4.0 daily assessment sequence exactly. The PM
reads top to bottom and every section they need to make a decision is present before the section that
requires that decision. Macro context before positions. Module status before alerts. Alerts before the
decision queue. The decision queue last.
This sequence is not negotiable. A dashboard that puts the equity book first and the regime
assessment second has inverted the logic. A PM who looks at position prices before understanding the
regime ceiling they are operating under is flying the jet before checking the instruments. The monitor
enforces discipline through layout.
Delivery time 6:00 AM CT daily — automated, no human involvement
Update frequency Regime score: continuous (every 5 min via RPE). Prices: real-
time during market hours. Module status: post-snapshot (5:30 AM
CT). Alerts: real-time triggered.
Delivery methods Primary: web dashboard (local network or secure tunnel).
Secondary: PDF email delivery. Both auto-generated from the
same data source.
Session log Every monitor generation event is logged with timestamp.
Immutable. LP narrative engine reads from this log.
Override No human edits the monitor output. It is generated from system
data. If data is wrong, fix the data source. Never manually edit
the output.

CRITICAL RENDERING RULE: The score bar fill color must encode position within the regime, not just
the regime label. A score of 0.68 (low end of DEFENSIVE) renders differently from 0.79 (high end of
DEFENSIVE). The bar shows exactly where within the regime the portfolio sits — proximity to the
boundary is information.

ORDERING RULE: Purple (major macro development) always first if present. Then danger. Then
warning. Then info. Then ok. Never reorder within severity tier. The PM reads alerts top to bottom and
acts in sequence.
Section 7 — PM Decision Queue
Position: last section. Always last. The PM has read everything above before arriving here.
The decision queue is the only section of the monitor that requires PM action. Each item is a numbered
alert box (red/amber/blue) with a bold action header and a 1–2 sentence instruction. Items are ordered
by urgency. Tier 0 actions never appear here — they have already executed. Tier 1 items appear here
with their veto window noted. Tier 2 and 3 items appear here with their confirmation requirement noted.
Maximum items 7. If more than 7 actions are queued, the system has failed to
execute Tier 0 actions correctly. Investigate.
Item numbering Sequential 1–N. Numbered bullets. Never unnumbered.
Item format [Number]. [BOLD ACTION LABEL]: [1-2 sentence instruction with
specific data points.]
Carryover items If an item appeared in yesterday's queue and was not actioned, it
shows in red with '⚑ CARRIED OVER FROM [DATE]' prefix. Two
carryovers = GP notification triggered.
Tier 1 items Show veto window remaining. e.g., 'Veto window: 2h 14m
remaining. No response = execute.'
Completion Items disappear from queue when actioned or when Tier 1
window expires and system executes. Never manually removed.
Section 8 — Footer
Footer is fixed at the bottom of every monitor. Contains: data source attribution, generation timestamp,
current regime score (numeric), previous regime score (numeric), Architecture AB version label, fund
name, confidentiality notice. Auto-generated. No human edits.
Example footer: 'Data sourced from public markets · Wednesday, March 25, 2026 · 6:00 AM CT ·
Regime score: DEFENSIVE 0.68 (prev: DEFENSIVE 0.74) · Architecture AB v4.0 · Achelion Capital
Management, LLC · Not for distribution'

3. Rendering Implementation
The monitor is rendered in two formats from a single data source. Josh builds the data assembly layer
once. The rendering layer is separate and produces both outputs.
Web dashboard Flask or FastAPI serving an HTML template. Accessible on local
network via Mac Mini IP address or via Cloudflare Tunnel for
remote access. Renders in any browser. Auto-refreshes every 5
minutes during market hours. Static at 6AM CT generation pre-
market.
PDF email delivery Playwright or WeasyPrint converts the HTML monitor to PDF.
SendGrid free tier (100 emails/day) or SMTP via Gmail delivers
to PM and GPs at 6:00 AM CT. PDF is the LP-ready format —
same content, exportable.
CSS design system Section colors, badge colors, alert box colors, and typography
must exactly match the specification in this document. No
creative interpretation. The layout encodes operational logic —
visual deviation is a specification error.
Dark mode Monitor must render correctly in both light and dark browser
modes. Use CSS variables for all colors. Never hardcode hex
values in the HTML template.
Mobile responsive The monitor must be readable on a phone without horizontal
scrolling. Use responsive grid for the four macro metric cards and
the two-column defensive sleeve section.

PART TWO
Mac Mini Server Architecture
4. Hardware Specification
The Mac Mini M4 Pro is the correct choice. Institutional quality at pre-institutional cost.
The Mac Mini is not a compromise. For a pre-launch fund running ARMS at current AUM, it is the
correct infrastructure choice. Cloud hosting (AWS/GCP) costs more monthly, introduces external
dependency, and adds latency between ARMS modules. A Mac Mini in a secure location with proper
networking is more reliable, more private, and more cost-effective for Phase 1 through Phase 3.
Component Specification Rationale
Model Mac Mini M4 Pro M4 Pro has 14-core CPU, 20-core
GPU, 24GB unified RAM minimum.
Runs Python ARMS stack,
PostgreSQL, Chroma, Flask, and
Prefect simultaneously without
throttling.
RAM 24GB minimum — 48GB
preferred
Chroma vector DB, PostgreSQL, and
multiple Python processes running
concurrently. 24GB is the floor. 48GB
gives headroom for Phase 3 ML
workloads.
Storage 512GB SSD minimum — 1TB
preferred
PostgreSQL session log, Chroma
vector embeddings, ARMS codebase,
and 2 years of rolling data fit
comfortably in 512GB. 1TB
recommended for Phase 3 growth.
Network Gigabit Ethernet — wired, not
WiFi
ARMS data ingestion and API calls
require consistent low-latency
connectivity. Never run ARMS on WiFi.
Static IP on local network.
UPS (Uninterruptible
Power Supply)
APC Back-UPS 600VA minimum
(~$80)
PostgreSQL and Chroma require clean
shutdown to prevent database
corruption. The UPS provides 10-20
minutes of runtime on power loss —
enough to execute a graceful
shutdown script.
ACHELION ARMS Infrastructure Specification — Monitor Layout + Mac Mini Architecture | CONFIDENTIAL
Achelion Capital Management, LLC · Flow. Illumination. Discipline. Conviction. 13
Backup External SSD 1TB + Time
Machine enabled
Daily encrypted backup of the entire
ARMS data directory. PostgreSQL
pg_dump scheduled nightly. Chroma
snapshot scheduled nightly. Off-site
backup via encrypted cloud (Backblaze
B2, ~$7/month).
Location Secure, climate-controlled,
always-on
Not a home office desk that gets
powered off. A dedicated location —
office server rack shelf, closet with
ventilation, or colocation cage. Mac
Mini is fanless under normal load —
runs cool and silent.
Approximate total cost $1,400–$1,800 hardware + ~$80
UPS + $7/month backup
One-time capital cost. No monthly
cloud fees for compute. Payback vs.
equivalent AWS EC2 instance: 8-12
months.

5. Three-Component Architecture
The Mac Mini closes three structural gaps identified in the strategic review. Each gap has a component.
Each component has a specific technology stack, a build specification, and a 'mile later' upgrade path.
Build all three in Phase 1 — they are not optional and they are not expensive.
Component 1 — Persistent Knowledge Base
Gap closed: ARMS currently has no memory between sessions. Context resets. Knowledge
does not compound.
A vector database stores every ARMS document, SENTINEL analysis, session log entry, and monitor
output as searchable embeddings. When any intelligence task is run — SENTINEL analysis, LP digest
generation, scan engine operation — the relevant context is retrieved from the knowledge base and
injected into the API call. The knowledge base compounds over time. The longer ARMS runs, the richer
the context it can provide.
Technology Chroma DB (open source, free, runs locally on Mac Mini)
Installation pip install chromadb — one command
Storage location ~/achelion/knowledge_base/ on Mac Mini SSD
Collections 5 collections: arms_documents, sentinel_analyses, session_log,
monitor_outputs, thesis_seeds
Embedding model OpenAI text-embedding-3-small via API ($0.02/1M tokens —
negligible cost) OR sentence-transformers locally (free, slightly
lower quality)
Retrieval Top-K semantic search. Each Claude API call retrieves the 5
most relevant chunks from the knowledge base before generating
output.
Update frequency arms_documents: on document change. sentinel_analyses: after
each SENTINEL run. session_log: real-time append.
monitor_outputs: after each generation. thesis_seeds: on PM
submission.
Backup Chroma snapshot nightly to external SSD + Backblaze B2
Knowledge base population — day one
1. Run the ingestion script on all existing ARMS documents: PM Playbook v4.0, THB v4.0, FSD
v1.1, this document, the full-cycle backtest, all SENTINEL analyses run to date.
2. Ingest all session log entries from the first day ARMS begins logging. The log is the primary
training data for the system's self-improvement loop.
ACHELION ARMS Infrastructure Specification — Monitor Layout + Mac Mini Architecture | CONFIDENTIAL
Achelion Capital Management, LLC · Flow. Illumination. Discipline. Conviction. 15
3. Set up the nightly incremental ingestion job via Prefect. New session log entries, monitor
outputs, and SENTINEL analyses are embedded and stored automatically.
How it connects to Claude API calls
# Every intelligence task follows this pattern:
def run_intelligence_task(query: str, task_type: str) -> str:
# 1. Retrieve relevant context from knowledge base
context = knowledge_base.query(
collection=task_type,
query_text=query,
n_results=5
)
# 2. Inject context into Claude API call
response = claude_api.call(
system=ARMS_SYSTEM_PROMPT,
context=context,
query=query
)
# 3. Store response back into knowledge base
knowledge_base.add(collection=task_type, text=response)
return response
Component 2 — Scheduled Autonomous Execution Layer
Gap closed: ARMS modules currently produce signals. Nothing acts on them automatically.
This closes that gap.
The scheduler is the heartbeat of the system. It triggers every ARMS module at its defined cadence,
passes outputs to downstream modules, and ensures the entire pipeline runs without human
involvement. When the scheduler runs correctly, the PM wakes up to a monitor that has already
assessed the regime, flagged positions, computed scenario P&L, and queued decision items — all
before 6AM CT.
Technology Prefect (open source, free tier, runs locally on Mac Mini)
Installation pip install prefect — one command. prefect server start to run
locally.
Alternative APScheduler (simpler, no UI) if Prefect overhead is unwanted for
Phase 1
Storage location ~/achelion/scheduler/ on Mac Mini
Failure handling Every scheduled job has a retry policy (3 attempts, 60-second
backoff). Failures alert to PM via email. Session log records all
failures with stack trace.

Component 3 — Claude API Integration Layer
ACHELION ARMS Infrastructure Specification — Monitor Layout + Mac Mini Architecture | CONFIDENTIAL
Achelion Capital Management, LLC · Flow. Illumination. Discipline. Conviction. 17
Gap closed: intelligence tasks currently require a human chat interface. This makes them
programmatic, continuous, and auditable.
The Claude API integration layer is a single Python module that every ARMS intelligence task routes
through. It manages the system prompt, context injection from the knowledge base, API call formatting,
response parsing, error handling, cost tracking, and result storage. No ARMS module calls the Claude
API directly — they all call this wrapper.
Technology Anthropic Python SDK (pip install anthropic)
Model claude-sonnet-4-6 — optimal balance of intelligence and cost for
ARMS tasks
File src/intelligence/claude_wrapper.py
System prompt Loaded from ~/achelion/config/arms_system_prompt.txt —
contains full ARMS context, regime definitions, SENTINEL gate
criteria, Architecture AB spec. Updated when architecture
changes.
Cost tracking Every API call logs: tokens in, tokens out, estimated cost, task
type, timestamp. Monthly cost report generated automatically.
Current target: <$300/month total API spend.
Rate limiting Built-in retry with exponential backoff. Max 3 retries. Failures
logged and PM notified.
Response validation Every response validated against expected schema before use.
JSON responses parsed and validated. Malformed responses
logged and flagged.

ARMS system prompt — what Claude knows at every call
The system prompt loaded at every API call contains the following in structured sections. This is what
makes every API response ARMS-aware rather than generic:
4. Complete Architecture AB specification: 58/20/14/8 · current equity book · conviction weights ·
defensive sleeve composition.
5. Five canonical regime labels and their ceilings, SLOF status, and behavioral rules.
6. SENTINEL gate criteria verbatim from PM Playbook v4.0.
7. MICS formula and source quality taxonomy.
8. Current regime label and score (injected fresh at each call).
9. Top 3 most recent session log entries (injected from knowledge base retrieval).
10. Current FEM status and active flags (injected from module output).

7. Network and Security Architecture
Security is not optional for a fund management system. Every component that touches portfolio data,
session logs, or LP information must be encrypted at rest and in transit. The following spec is the
minimum acceptable standard for a registered investment vehicle.
Security control Implementation Rationale
Disk encryption macOS FileVault enabled on
Mac Mini
All ARMS data, session logs, and API
keys encrypted at rest. Required for
any system holding portfolio data.
API key management macOS Keychain or HashiCorp
Vault (free)
Never hardcode API keys in source
code. Load from secure key store at
runtime. Rotate keys quarterly.
Network access Wired ethernet. Router firewall.
No public-facing ports except via
Cloudflare Tunnel.
Mac Mini never directly exposed to the
internet. Cloudflare Tunnel creates an
outbound-only encrypted connection.
Web dashboard auth Cloudflare Access (free tier) —
email OTP or Google OAuth
Dashboard is not publicly accessible.
PM and GPs authenticate before
viewing.
Database encryption PostgreSQL with encrypted
tablespace OR pgcrypto for
sensitive columns
Session log and portfolio data
encrypted at the column level for the
most sensitive fields.
Backup encryption Restic (free) with AES-256
encryption before Backblaze
upload
Backblaze never sees unencrypted
data. Key stored in macOS Keychain.
Code repository Private GitHub repo with 2FA
required for all contributors
ARMS codebase never in a public
repository. Branch protection on main.
Incident response UPS graceful shutdown script.
Prefect failure alerts to PM email
within 2 minutes of any job
failure.
System failure does not mean data
loss or uncontrolled execution.

8. Mac Mini Setup Sequence — Josh's Day One
Complete in this order. Do not skip steps. Each step is a dependency for the next.
Day 1 — Hardware and Base OS
11. Unbox Mac Mini M4 Pro. Connect via ethernet — not WiFi. Connect to UPS.
12. Enable FileVault disk encryption immediately. Before installing anything.
13. Create a dedicated 'achelion' user account. Do not use as primary personal machine.
14. Install Homebrew: /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
15. brew install python@3.11 postgresql@16 git
16. Configure PostgreSQL to start on login: brew services start postgresql@16
17. Create the ARMS database: createdb achelion_arms
18. Install Uptime Kuma via Docker for system monitoring.
Day 2 — Python Environment and Core Dependencies
19. python3.11 -m venv ~/achelion/venv && source ~/achelion/venv/bin/activate
20. pip install anthropic chromadb prefect fastapi uvicorn weasyprint ib_insync psycopg2-binary
openai sentence-transformers restic
21. Clone the ARMS private GitHub repo: git clone [repo URL] ~/achelion/arms
22. Set up macOS Keychain entries for: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY (for
embeddings), IBKR credentials, SendGrid API key.
23. Initialize Chroma DB: python -c "import chromadb; client =
chromadb.PersistentClient(path='~/achelion/knowledge_base')"
24. Run the knowledge base ingestion script on all existing ARMS documents (FSD v1.1, PM
Playbook v4.0, THB v4.0, this document, full-cycle backtest).
Day 3 — Scheduling and Web Dashboard
25. prefect server start — start the local Prefect server.
26. Configure all Prefect flows from the master schedule in Section 5.
27. Build the FastAPI daily monitor web app: uvicorn arms.dashboard:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
28. Install and configure Cloudflare Tunnel: cloudflared tunnel create achelion — generates a
secure public URL for the dashboard.
29. Configure Cloudflare Access: restrict dashboard to PM and GP email addresses via Google
OAuth.
30. Test the full pipeline: trigger the daily monitor job manually and verify HTML and PDF output.

Day 4 — Broker API and IBKR Paper Connection
31. Install IBKR Trader Workstation (TWS) or IB Gateway on the Mac Mini.
32. Configure TWS for API access: Enable ActiveX and Socket Clients in settings.
33. Test ib_insync connection: python -c "from ib_insync import *; ib = IB(); ib.connect('127.0.0.1',
7497, clientId=1); print(ib.positions())"
34. Build broker_api.py — the sole interface between ARMS and IBKR. No other module touches
IBKR directly.
35. Run the regime transition test from FSD v1.1 Section 8.4 against the paper account.
Day 5 — MICS and Intelligence Layer
36. Build mics.py using the formula in FSD v1.1 Section 11.1. Run it against all existing Architecture
AB positions. Compare output to current PM-assigned C-levels. Document any divergence >2
levels for GP review.
37. Build claude_wrapper.py — the Claude API integration layer from Section 5 Component 3.
38. Load the ARMS system prompt from ~/achelion/config/arms_system_prompt.txt.
39. Test a SENTINEL Gate 1+2 analysis call with a test ticker. Verify JSON output matches
schema.
40. Run the first Systematic Scan Engine job manually on a 10-company test universe. Verify output
and cost.
After Day 5: ARMS has a home, a heartbeat, a brain, and a broker connection. Phase 1 is operational.
The PM receives the daily monitor at 6AM CT. The system runs without human involvement. The
inches have been taken.

9. On SuperAGI and Manus — Where They Fit
SuperAGI and Manus are general-purpose autonomous agent frameworks. They are powerful and
genuinely useful for certain workflows. They are not the right tool for ARMS execution. The distinction
matters.
Dimension General-purpose agent (SuperAGI /
Manus) ARMS architecture
Design goal Flexibility — figure out how to do
something novel
Discipline — execute a defined
protocol exactly the same way
every time
Decision model Agent decides what to do next
based on context
Module fires when trigger condition
is met. No discretion.
Auditability Variable — depends on agent
framework logging
Every action logged with triggering
module, signal, and timestamp.
Immutable.
Predictability Lower — agent may choose
unexpected paths
Complete — output of every
module is deterministic given the
same inputs
LP defensibility Difficult — 'the agent decided' is not
an acceptable answer
Complete — every decision
traceable to a specific module and
trigger condition
Best use in Achelion
stack
Intelligence layer above ARMS —
news monitoring, transcript
synthesis, scan engine analysis,
digest drafting
Execution layer — regime
enforcement, order submission,
position sizing, hedge management
SuperAGI and Manus feed ARMS. They do not run ARMS. The architecture is clear: agent
intelligence above, disciplined execution below.
A SuperAGI agent connected to the Mac Mini and the Claude API integration layer could continuously
monitor news feeds, summarize earnings transcripts for the Systematic Scan Engine, surface breaking
developments for the daily alert section, and draft LP communication. This is a valuable Phase 3 or
Phase 4 addition. It plugs into the feed-agnostic data ingestion layer Josh builds in Phase 1 as a plugin
— no rearchitecting required.
What it never does: submit orders, change regime ceilings, modify position weights, or override any
ARMS module output. Those domains belong to the deterministic execution layer. Any agent that can
modify execution is a liability, not an asset, in a regulated fund context.

10. Closing Statement
A Mac Mini, $160/month, and five days of Josh's time. That is the cost of giving ARMS a
permanent home.
After Day 5, the following is true: ARMS runs continuously without human involvement. The PM
receives a fully specified daily monitor at 6AM CT. Every regime transition executes automatically.
Every position flag generates an alert. The knowledge base compounds with every session. The
Claude API provides intelligence on demand. The broker connection is ready for live execution the
moment paper trading validation is complete.
This is not a prototype. This is the foundation of a fund management platform that has never existed at
this size. The infrastructure cost is lower than one month of Bloomberg terminal fees. The capability it
unlocks is institutional.
The monitor layout specification in Part One ensures that what the PM reads every morning is not a
dashboard — it is a decision instrument that encodes 28 years of risk management discipline into a
visual sequence. The Mac Mini architecture in Part Two ensures that instrument is always ready,
always current, and always honest.
"Silence is trust in the architecture."
