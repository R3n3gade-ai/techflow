STATUS CONFIDENTIAL — Development team and authorized GP use only. v4.0 is the canonical build target for
Josh. All prior versions superseded.
1. AUTHORITY HIERARCHY — UNCHANGED IN V4.0
The seven-pillar authority hierarchy is unchanged. New v4.0 modules are ADVISORY or ADDITIVE — they
tighten ceilings further or provide information, but they never loosen what ARAS has set. The Portfolio Drawdown
Sentinel (PDS) is the only new module with ceiling authority, and its ceiling is always at or below ARAS.
AUTHORITY RULE
ARAS — Highest Absolute exposure ceiling. Cannot be exceeded by any module, human, or override.
PDS — New v4.0 Portfolio Drawdown Sentinel sets its own ceiling. LOWER of ARAS or PDS ceiling always
prevails. PDS can only make the portfolio MORE defensive than ARAS, never less.
FEM — Advisory Factor Exposure Monitor is ADVISORY. It flags concentration risk to the PM but does not
override ARAS or PDS ceilings.
PTRH — Additive Permanent Tail Risk Hedge exists OUTSIDE the exposure ceiling calculation. QQQ puts
are protective instruments, not offensive exposure.
2. GAP 1 — FACTOR EXPOSURE MONITOR (FEM)
The FEM is a new ARAS sub-module that detects hidden concentration risk across positions. ARMS can be in
RISK_ON at 100% ceiling while effectively running a single concentrated bet — AI semiconductor, Taiwan
manufacturing, BTC beta, or dollar sensitivity. The FEM surfaces this to the PM before it becomes a drawdown.
2.1 Factor Definitions
FACTOR POSITIONS AFFECTED WEIGHT METHOD

BTC Beta IBIT, ETHB, BSOL, PLTR (BTC
treasury), TSLA (BTC treasury) BTC correlation coefficient × position weight
FACTOR POSITIONS AFFECTED WEIGHT METHOD

correlation) 90-day DXY correlation × position weight (signed)
Rate Sensitivity VRT, ETN, ANET (infrastructure
capex), SGOV (positive) Duration-equivalent sensitivity to 100bps rate move
2.2 Thresholds and Actions
LEVEL THRESHOLD ACTION
WATCH >65% single factor PM alert on daily monitor. No mandatory action. Document in session log.
ALERT >80% single factor Mandatory PM review within 24 hours. If not resolved by conviction update
or trim, escalate to ARAS as input signal (advisory +0.05 composite).
Cross-sleeve
CORR >0.70 equity/crypto 30d Advisory flag. Feeds existing SYS-5 / SYS-5B contagion monitors. Not a
new ceiling.
2.3 Interface Contract — FactorExposureSignal

2.4 File: src/modules/factor_exposure.py
Runs daily after portfolio snapshot is calculated. Inputs: position weights, beta estimates, correlation matrix (rolling
90d). Output: FactorExposureSignal. Feeds into ARAS composite as advisory input only. Feeds into daily monitor
display.
3. GAP 2 — VOLATILITY-ADJUSTED RE-ENTRY SIZING (VARES)
ARES re-entry is enhanced with volatility-adjusted tranche sizing. Re-entry tranche size is inversely proportional
to current VIX relative to its 90-day moving average. When volatility is elevated at re-entry, position sizes are
smaller. When volatility is normalized, position sizes return to full. This is standard practice at every major risk-
managed fund.
3.1 VARES Formula
# Vol adjustment factor vix_90d_avg = mean(VIX, lookback=90) vol_adj_factor = min(1.0,
vix_90d_avg / vix_current) # Applied to base tranche size base_tranche_pct = 0.33 # always 3
equal tranches of target adjusted_tranche = base_tranche_pct * vol_adj_factor # Hard limits
adjusted_tranche = max(0.15, min(0.35, adjusted_tranche)) # Example: # VIX current = 35, VIX 90d
avg = 20 # vol_adj_factor = 20/35 = 0.571 # adjusted_tranche = 0.33 * 0.571 = 0.188 (18.8% of
target per tranche) # Result: you come back at 57% of normal tranche size when vol is elevated
3.2 Tranche Timing
TRANCHE TIMING SIZE CONDITION
T1 Gate 4 clear + PM approval base × vol_adj_factor ARES gates 1-4 all clear. Composite below
DEFENSIVE threshold.
T2 T1 + 48 hours Same as T1 Regime held for 48h post-T1. No new circuit
breaker. Composite stable or declining.
TRANCHE TIMING SIZE CONDITION
T3 T2 + 48 hours Remainder to target Regime held for 48h post-T2. Full deployment
reached. SLOF reactivation PM discretion.
ABORT Any tranche window Halt all tranches If any circuit breaker fires between tranches:
abort re-entry, return to current regime ceiling.

4. GAP 3 — PORTFOLIO DRAWDOWN SENTINEL (PDS)
CRITICAL — INDEPENDENT MODULE
The Portfolio Drawdown Sentinel operates INDEPENDENTLY of ARAS. It monitors portfolio NAV against its
rolling high-water mark. It is the last line of defense when ARAS is wrong or slow. PDS and ARAS ceilings
are always compared — the lower ceiling always prevails. ARAS cannot override PDS. PDS cannot override
ARAS. They coexist, each setting a floor on risk.
4.1 Drawdown Thresholds
LEVEL DRAWDOWN FROM HWM ACTION CEILING
WARNING −8% from HWM
PM alert. No mandatory action.
Heightened monitoring. Document in
daily log.
None — advisory only
DELEVERAGE 1 −12% from HWM
Automatic — force portfolio to 60%
gross ceiling. Independent of ARAS
regime.
60% gross
DELEVERAGE 2 −18% from HWM
Automatic — force portfolio to 30%
gross ceiling. PM notified. LP
communication triggered.
30% gross
4.2 High-Water Mark Rules
The HWM is the portfolio's highest ever closing NAV. It updates daily when a new high is set. It never decrements — it
only moves up. When the portfolio closes below the prior HWM, the drawdown clock starts. The drawdown is calculated
as (current_NAV / HWM) − 1.
4.3 PDS + ARAS Interaction Rule
# Each session, determine effective ceiling: aras_ceiling = aras_output.exposure_ceiling #
e.g., 1.00 (RISK_ON) pds_ceiling = drawdown_sentinel.ceiling # e.g., 0.60 (DELEVERAGE
1) effective_ceiling = min(aras_ceiling, pds_ceiling) # 0.60 prevails # PDS ceiling persists
until: # 1. Portfolio NAV recovers above HWM − 8% (exit WARNING) # 2. Portfolio NAV recovers
above HWM − 12% (exit DELEVERAGE 1) # 3. Explicit PM override with documented justification (PDS
only — ARAS cannot be overridden)
4.4 DrawdownSentinelSignal Dataclass
@dataclass class DrawdownSentinelSignal: as_of: str current_nav: float

File: src/engine/drawdown_sentinel.py. Runs daily after NAV calculation. DB table: drawdown_sentinel_log. Feeds
into daily monitor as a separate status banner.
5. GAP 4 — LIQUIDITY-ADJUSTED EXECUTION PROTOCOL (LAEP)
SYS-3 execution methodology adjusts automatically based on market liquidity conditions at the time of execution.
In normal markets, market orders execute within 30 minutes. In elevated volatility, VWAP orders extend to 60
minutes. In crisis, VWAP extends to 90 minutes with priority reordering to protect the least liquid positions.
5.1 Liquidity Mode Classification
MODE VIX TRIGGER ORDER TYPE WINDOW SLIPPAGE BUDGET PRIORITY ORDER
NORMAL VIX < 25 Market 30 min 8 bps est. P1→P2→P3→P4
ELEVATED VIX 25–45 VWAP 60 min 20 bps est. P1→P2→P3→P4
CRISIS VIX > 45 VWAP 90 min 40 bps est. BSOL→ETHB→IBIT→equity
CRISIS PRIORITY REORDER RATIONALE
In CRISIS mode (VIX >45), BSOL is executed first because it is the least liquid crypto ETF — the widest
spread, highest market impact. ETHB second (newer, less liquid than IBIT). IBIT third (most liquid crypto
ETF). Equity last because major ETF components (TSLA, NVDA) have the deepest liquidity even in crisis. This
is the opposite of normal priority — in crisis, you exit the illiquid positions first while you still can.
5.2 LiquidityMode Enum + Extended OrderBookEntry

6. GAP 5 — PERMANENT TAIL RISK HEDGE (PTRH)
QQQ PUTS — NOT SPX
The PTRH uses QQQ puts, not SPX puts. Rationale: Achelion's 58% equity sleeve is concentrated in AI
infrastructure names that trade as NASDAQ/QQQ proxies. In a technology-specific drawdown — the
primary risk — QQQ falls materially harder than SPX (2022: QQQ −32.6% vs SPX −18.1%). QQQ puts
provide approximately 1.8x the protection of SPX puts per dollar of premium in the scenarios most relevant
to this portfolio.
6.1 Hedge Structure
PARAMETER SPECIFICATION
Instrument QQQ put options — listed, exchange-traded
Strike 10–15% out-of-the-money from current QQQ price. Recalibrate at each roll.
Expiry 60–90 day options. Roll at 30 DTE to avoid gamma decay acceleration.
PARAMETER SPECIFICATION
Target protection 10–15% portfolio protection in a −30% QQQ scenario. Size to achieve this payoff
profile.
Annual premium cost Target 0.30–0.50% NAV per year at base size. At $50M AUM: approx $150K–
$250K/year.
Relationship to SLOF PTRH is a protective put position — it does NOT count against SLOF overlay limits. It
is a separate sleeve in the options budget.
Exposure ceiling PTRH is EXEMPT from ARAS gross exposure calculation — identical treatment
to the defensive sleeve.
6.2 Regime-Dependent Sizing
ADDENDUM 4 SUPERSESSION NOTICE (March 27, 2026): The CRASH row in the table below has been updated. The prior
specification (“Hold at 150% — no new buys”) is superseded by the Coverage Adequacy Model (CAM) specified in Addendum 4 to FSD
v1.1. In CRASH regime, CAM autonomously calculates required PTRH coverage every 5 minutes using four multipliers (regime score,
equity exposure, FEM concentration, macro stress) and auto-corrects notional to the required level. The 2.0× minimum in CRASH is a
floor — CAM may require higher coverage depending on current risk configuration. The PM is never asked about PTRH sizing under any
conditions after CAM is live. See src/engine/cam.py.
REGIME PTRH SIZE STRC DYNAMIC LAYER COMBINED PROTECTION
RISK_ON 100% base (1.0×) Locked — not deployed Permanent hedge only
WATCH 125% base (1.25×) Locked Permanent + 25% upsize
NEUTRAL 125% base 50% reserve deployed (QQQ puts) Permanent + STRC reserve layer
DEFENSIVE 150% base (1.5×) 100% reserve deployed Maximum hedge stack
CRASH
2.0× base (CAM
autonomous) —
supersedes prior “hold at
150%” rule. See
Addendum 4.
All in
CAM calculates required coverage
every 5 min. Auto-corrects notional.
PM not involved. Addendum 4
governs.

7. GAP 6 — CONVICTION DECAY FUNCTION (CDF)
The CDF extends the existing Conviction Drift Monitor to make it actionable. The Drift Monitor currently flags
positions that deviate >20% from their C²-implied contribution after 45 days. The CDF adds automatic conviction
weight reduction when a position underperforms its thesis — preventing the most dangerous behavior in
concentrated portfolios: doubling down on a broken thesis.
7.1 Underperformance Trigger
# CDF fires when BOTH conditions are met for N consecutive days: condition_1 =
position_return_45d < (qqq_return_45d - 0.10) # -10pp vs QQQ condition_2 = days_underperforming
>= 45 # Decay schedule if days_underperforming >= 45: conviction_decay_factor = 0.80 # C²-
weight × 0.80 (C10 → effective C9) if days_underperforming >= 90: conviction_decay_factor =
0.60 # C²-weight × 0.60 (C10 → effective C8) if days_underperforming >= 135:
conviction_decay_factor = 0.60 # Hold at 0.60 — mandatory PM review # Reset condition if
position_outperforms_qqq_by_5pp_over_15d: conviction_decay_factor = 1.00 # Full restoration
7.2 Impact on Position Sizing
The conviction_decay_factor multiplies the C² weight in the Master Engine. A position with C10 (C²=100) and
decay_factor=0.80 behaves as if it had C²=80 (C9) for position sizing purposes. This means the position is sized smaller
without requiring an explicit PM sell decision. The PM retains full control — they can override the decay with a
documented conviction reaffirmation.
WHAT CDF DOES NOT DO
CDF does not force a sell. It does not trigger a regime change. It does not reduce the SLOF eligibility of the
position. It only reduces the position's effective weight in the Master Engine portfolio construction
calculation. The PM can override at any time with a documented justification. The decay is visible on the
daily monitor as a flag next to the position.

8. GAP 7 — STRESS SCENARIO LIBRARY (SSL)
The SSL runs daily after portfolio snapshot. It applies eight defined historical and custom stress scenarios to the
current portfolio weights and outputs estimated P&L for each. This gives the PM information the regime model
cannot provide — not what has already happened, but what would happen if a defined stress event occurred today.
